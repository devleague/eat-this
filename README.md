# Eat This!
Where should I eat?

An app that helps users decide what and where they "want" to eat in a specified location near them.

## Instructions for startup
1. Run `npm install` for node module dependencies.
1. Run `bower install` for bower components dependencies.
1. Source environment needs to be running before starting up server.
  2. Run `source .env`.
  2. Run `env` (without a period).
  2. Ensure that you run the next command in the same terminal window as the env file.
1. Run `gulp` to start server.
  2. Basic nodemon server will run at `localhost:8080` -- without live refreshing.
  2. For live refreshing while editing code -- go to `localhost:3000`.
1. Make sure location services are turned on in-browser or server will break (to be fixed).
