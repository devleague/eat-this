# Eat This!
Where should I eat?

An app that helps users decide what and where they "want" to eat in a specified location near them.

## Instructions for startup
1. Run `npm install` for node module and bower dependencies.
1. Run `npm run dev` to start up project.
  2. This will do `source .env` and `gulp` with one command and in one session!
  2. No need to run two commands ever again!
  2. Will improve upon this at another time.
1. There are two urls you can visit for different purposes.
  2. `localhost:8080` will run basic nodemon server with NO refreshing after changes.
  2. `localhost:3000` will run a live-refreshing version of the project when saving changes.
1. Make sure location services are turned on in-browser or server will break (to be fixed).
