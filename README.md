# Eat This!
Where should I eat?

An app that helps users decide what and where they "want" to eat in a specified location near them.

## Instructions for startup

1. Do `npm install -g ionic cordova` for fresh installers.
1. You'll need two seperate terminal sessions to run the server and the client side.

### Client (Ionic)
1. Change directories into `app`.
1. Run `npm install` for node module dependencies.
1. Run `bower install` for bower dependencies.
1. Start `ionic serve`.
1. You can view the front-end at `localhost:8100`.

### Server
1. Insure you are in the root directory of the project.
1. Run `npm install` for node module dependencies.
1. Start at `npm run dev`.
  2. This will also take care of the `source .env` command.
  2. Note that gulp will no longer run server side.
1. Server will run at `localhost:8080`.
  2. However you won't be needing to go there right now.

Note: Please make sure location services are turned on in-browser or NO information will be returned on the client side.
