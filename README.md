# Eat This!
Where should I eat?

An app that helps users decide what and where they "want" to eat in a specified location near them.

## Instructions for startup
1. Run `npm install` for node module dependencies.
1. Run `bower install` for bower components dependencies.
1. Source environment needs to be running before starting up server.
  2. Run `source .env`.
  2. Run `env` (without a period).
  2. Start server at `nodemon`.
    3. Make sure nodemon is started in the same terminal window as the env file.
1. Make sure location services are turned on in-browser or server will break (to be fixed).
